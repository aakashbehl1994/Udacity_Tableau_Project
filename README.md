Summary
How the population of the World is developing over the past 50 years. People believe that making everyone healthy and living longer will lead to overpopulation. I tried to answer this question in this project by comparing increasing life expectancy with fertility rate globally and how they relate to population growth.
Design
•	I choose a World map to show the population of each individual country across each year from 1960’s to early 2010’s.
•	I choose a line chart to show the population growth across the world and also for some individual countries India, China, U.S.A., Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico are amoung the most heavily populated countries.
•	I used a line chart to show the life expectancy globally and also per country, I saw the highest increase in life expectancy in countries like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.
•	I used a line chart to show the fertility rates globally and per country, there is a heavy decrease in fertility rates globally and specially in countries like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.
•	I created an interactive animation(5 dimensional) which can cleary show how from 1960’s to 2010’s the life expectancy and fertility rates of each country is changing along with the population.
Feedback
1) The vizualisation started on the conclusion sheet, make sure you save at the beginning before posting.
Action: The sheet was saved at the beginning before posting.
2) Make the charts smaller and fit them into view.
Action: I changed the size of my charts to fit them into my view.
3) The heading in the first page of project is not being able to feed people due to overpopulation which did not match with the content.
Action: The heading was changed to comparing life expectancy and overpopulation.
4) You might want to put the Country Name legend next to Individual population instead. It was a bit confusing when you placed it next to world population.
Action: The Country name legend was put next to Individual population.
5) The comment in Life expectancy Globally covering your graph title, can you somehow make it go away?
Action: The legend was Shifted downward and the text was moved to the upper right corner.
